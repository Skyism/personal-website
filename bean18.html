    <p>For the 2024 Build18 Buildathon, my team and I made a drivable beanbag using hoverboard motors. We used Wii Nunchuks to control steering, acceleration, and turn signals and created a separate breakout PCB board to attach the arduino to the Wii Nunchuks. We will have a 36V battery with fuse (for safety reasons) with 4 motor controllers in parallel and a 5V regulator for the arduino. Arduino will send signals to each of the four motors from the Wii Nunchucks with 3 signal wires for each motor (PWM, Brake, Reverse). We also have 8 Wires from each motor controller to each motor for communication and an aesthetically designed LED turn signal on the back.

      This project was great for applying the knowledge I learned in Carnegie Mellon Racing and ECE since the project heavily relied on firmware to read the I2C communication from the Wii. In addition, I learned woodworking and CAD skills as well. Most importantly, I had an incredible time building with my team, sharing laughs and creating some really unforgettable memories together.
