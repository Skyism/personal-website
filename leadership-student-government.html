    <h2>CMU Student Senate</h2>
    <p>As one of 13 elected Senator representing 1,800 undergraduate students in Carnegie Mellon's College of Engineering, 
        I gained invaluable experience in democratic leadership, budget management, and large-scale project coordination. 
        This role required balancing diverse student needs while working within complex institutional frameworks to drive 
        meaningful change. I actively participated in managing multiple student life initiatives, including the School 
        Supply Financial Assistance program and Free Legal Services, collectively overseeing budgets exceeding $250,000. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I learned a lot of soft skills as well in this role, especially communication and how to better work with people. It enhanced my abilities in public speaking, 
        committee presentations, and cross-functional collaboration with university officials, contractors, and student organizations. I think this role
        prepares me well for the workplace by teaching me how to navigate bureaucracy, listen with an open mind, and how to solve problems collaboratively.
